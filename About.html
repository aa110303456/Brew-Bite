        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Brew & Bite is more than just a café; it's a place where moments are shared, routines are treasured, and friendships are made.</p>
        <p>Brew & Bite, a tiny business project founded in 2009 in Central London by Emma Leo. This idea is driven by her passion for homemade cookies, freshly brewed coffee, and the natural joy of connecting people together.</p>
        <p>In Emma's opinion, great coffee should be combined with coziness, warmth, and authenticity.</p>
        <p>Driven by the love and devotion of its customers, Brew & Bite now has over 3,000 locations in more than 30 countries.</p>
